## Description

  * Anaconda3 with a bunch of extra R and Python packages for data science
    * See */cfg/anaconda.txt* for the full list!
  * Beakerx (https://github.com/twosigma/beakerx) which gives kernels for Clojure, Java, Scala, Sql, Kotlin, and Groovy
  * SciJava (https://github.com/scijava/scijava-jupyter-kernel) providing Clojure, Groovy, ImageJ, Python, JavaScript, and R within the same notebook
